/*Get all products from the API: https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/books
1. Display all the books using template literals and .forEach()
2. Add an add to cart button into each item
3. When this button is pressed: 1) add the item to another list (the cart), and 2) change the card styling to show that the element is in the cart (eg. red border, a badge, an iconâ€¦ you choose)
4. Add a skip button inside each card
5. When pressed, this button should remove that book element from the page
6. Add a search bar. When the user types more than 3 characters, filter the content of the API response to only display the books with a matching (or partially matching) title (hint: use .filter())
7. Allow users to delete books from their cart
8. Count the cart items using a .reduce() method and display the result somewhere in the cart
EXTRAS:
1. Add a empty cart button, to delete the whole list
2. Create a detail page: when the user clicks on a book, they get redirected to another page. Pass the ASIN as a query string.
3. In the detail page, show the details of the book matching the ASIN in the query string: use this endpoint: https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/books/your_id_here */
